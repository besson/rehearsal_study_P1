This page describes a development guide that the developers must follow to implement the four development tasks of the proposed study. A <a href="http://valinhos.ime.usp.br:54080/rehearsal/rehearsal-study.ova">virtual machine</a> containing all needed tools and software dependencies was created. Each group will execute the tasks below in an instance of this virtual machine.

	<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
</hgroup>
<b>Thanks for attending this study =] </b><br>
<ul>
<li>During the study, fell free to ask about any doubt or problem anytime. In the page <a href="info.html"><span style='color:blue'>info</span></a> you can find
information about the Virtual Machine, the path of tools in the VM, and about the URIs where mocks and interceptors must be deployed. This last information are also provided
in the descriptions of the development tasks. </li>
<li>Please execute the tasks in order, even if the steps are too easy.</li>
<li>Try to change the guy who is coding for each 2 hours or even less if you want to</li> 
<li>Finally, when writing a test case for something that is not developed yet, run the test case anyway and 
see it fail. Then, code the service/composition to make it passes  </li><br> <br> <br>
 
<b>Before starting the tasks below, please start the Petals ESB by running:</b>
<pre>
$ /home/rehearsal/study/tools/petals-platform-3.1.3/bin/startup.sh
</pre>

Petals must be running during the entire study. Please start the development of the choreography by cllicking on the <b>Task 01 </b>. Each task represents a phase of our proposed TDD methodology for web service choreographies.
