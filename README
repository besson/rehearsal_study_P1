REHEARSAL STUDY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains all code (choreography, services, tests, ....) that were developed in an exploratory 
study to assess Rehearsal and a TDD methodology proposal (http://ccsl.ime.usp.br/baile/VandV). More information 
about this study can be found in: http://www.ime.usp.br/~besson/rehearsal-study/

--------------------------
Pre conditions
--------------------------
The file frascati must replace the frascati that exists in your current frascati installation ($FRASCATI_HOME/bin)

--------------------------
Considerations
--------------------------
The choreography used in the study can be enacted using or not Petals. In the study we did not use petals. If 
you want to use Petals, please use the script petals_task.sh to deploy the service assemblies. In the case of using 
Petals the composite descriptors (.composite) are in the folder resource of role. In the case of not using Petals, 
the ./composite folder contains the composite descriptors and the ./resources folder contains the service contracts.

-------------------------
Repository organization
-------------------------
The repository contains the following projects:

- webTrip: a web service that is mocked in the study
- park_safe: the legacy system for managing car park reservations
- car_parking_ws: the web service developed based on the park safe system
- car_park_reservation: the composite representing the carParkReservation role
- flight_finder: the composite representing the flightFinder role
- interactive_guide: the composite representing the interactiveGuide role
- item_explorer: a tool that supports Rehearsal
- petals_service-units: petals service assemblies.
- resources: web service contracts that are used when the choreography is enacted without Petals
- training: contains Java projects used by the subjects in the training stage
- composites: composite descriptors (.composite) that are used when the choreography is enacted without Petals
- wsdl_interfaces: web service contracts 

-------------------------
Branches
-------------------------

- master: the code used by the subjects to perform the training and development stages
- tasks_completed: the code developed by the researcher containing the expected code (when all tasks have been
developed)
- team1: the code developed by the team 1 during the study
- team2: the code developed by the team 2 during the study
- team3: the code developed by the team 3 during the study
- team4: the code developed by the team 4 during the study
